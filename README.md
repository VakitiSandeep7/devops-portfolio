This repository contains a full-stack, containerized portfolio application designed with a **Microservices Architecture**. It features a decoupled Frontend and Backend system connected via a Managed PostgreSQL Database.

## 🏗️ The Architecture
- **Frontend:** Glassmorphism UI built with Vanilla JS and CSS3. Consumes REST APIs asynchronously.
- **Backend:** Python/Django API containerized with Docker and served by Gunicorn.
- **Database:** Managed PostgreSQL instance on Render Cloud.
- **CI/CD:** Automated deployment pipeline via GitHub hooks to Render.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) logic.
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3), Render Cloud.
- **Backend:** Python 3.12, Django REST Framework.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL.
- **Security:** Implementation of Hybrid Cryptography and Breach Prediction models.

## 🚀 Deployment Highlights
- **Containerization:** Standardized the environment using a custom `Dockerfile`.
- **Environment Management:** Secured sensitive data (DB URLs, API Keys) using injected Environment Variables.
- **Cross-Origin Handling:** Configured CORS headers to allow secure communication between the frontend and backend domains.
